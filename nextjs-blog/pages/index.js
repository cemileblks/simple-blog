          Hi, I'm Cemile! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a front-end web developer with a background in
          genetics ðŸ§¬. Iâ€™m fascinated to see life sciences references in web
          development despite being inherently different fields. I enjoy what I
          do because it makes me think in new ways and learn something new
          everyday. I also enjoy sharing what I know and learning from others,
          which makes what I do even more rewarding! Read on to discover
          interesting things I've found along the way. ðŸŒŸ
        </p>
